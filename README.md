# Collision Game (C++ & Raylib)

A simple beginner-friendly game built in C++ using the Raylib framework.
This is my first game project while learning both C++ and Raylib!

# *Gameplay*

You control a circle that can move left and right using the keyboard:

A → Move left

D → Move right

In the middle of the window, a square moves up and down automatically.
Your goal is simple:

Avoid colliding with the moving square. If you touch it — game over!

# *Features*

Smooth left/right movement for the player circle

Automatically moving obstacle (square)

Collision detection

Basic game-over logic

Clean and minimal Raylib structure — great for beginners

# *Technologies Used*

C++

Raylib

# *What I Learned*

Basic game loop structure

Handling keyboard input

Drawing shapes in Raylib

Simple collision detection
